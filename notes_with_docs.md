## Setting up the Backend

- **First** we need to make sure our directories and file structure are configured the right way. A popular way is to have a frontend folder and backend folder. Most importantly to seperate concerns and to avoid dependency errors.
- When you use express(backend webframework for node) you want to set up controllers in a different file, you could do it all together but its not common practice
